    },
    {
      "subheading": "Why Animate at All?",

      "text": "GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) has been around forever and still slaps. It’s incredibly fast, works everywhere, and gives you laser-sharp control over timelines and sequences. You can stagger complex animations, scrub with scroll, or choreograph scenes with surgical precision."

      "text": "If you’re in the React/Next.js ecosystem, Framer Motion is a dream.

You also get spring physics, variants, gestures, and layout-aware transitions—right out of the box."

      "subheading": "When to Use What?",
      "text": "- 🟢 **GSAP**: Use it when you need timeline choreography, SVG magic, scroll-based scenes, or you're not in a React project.\n- 🟣 **Framer Motion**: Use it for React apps, reusable animations tied to component lifecycle, page transitions in Next.js, or rapid prototyping."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Hot Take: Combine Them?",
      "text": "Yeah, you can blend GSAP with React using refs, but it gets messy. Framer Motion handles most UI-level motion smoothly. GSAP dominates when you want to orchestrate complex narrative-like flows or parallax magic."

Don’t trap users in modals. \n\nAccessibility is not a checklist—it’s core to usable design. If your interface only works for sighted, mouse-using, neurotypical users… you’ve failed a huge part of your audience."

Then handoff happens.\n\nThe dev: 'This hover state isn’t in the spec.'\nYou: 'It was in the prototype.'\nThe dev: 'What prototype?'\n\nSolution? Build a living style guide. Collaborate early. And yes, expect the occasional pixel betrayal. It builds character."

Because even the best UI gets stale without real user feedback and evolution."
